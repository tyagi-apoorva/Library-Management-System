# Library-Management-System
Here, I have developed a full stack web application on Library Management System. It has Admin side and Student side with their functionalities.
Some of them include Add_Book, Book_Reuest, Issue_Book, Fine, Feedback etc. I have used HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT for Front-end and PHP,  SQL for backend.
It has Authentication for both Admin and Student. They can update and change their passwords in case they forget them.

This project can be run in the browser using XAMPP server. Firstly, install XAMPP server on your machine. Then run Apache and SQL.
Inside PhpMyAdmin you have to create your Database Library which has different Tables. These are Admin, Student, Issue_Book, Fine, Books, Comments, Message.
Then you can simply execute the code provided.
